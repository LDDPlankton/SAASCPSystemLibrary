# SAASCPSystemLibrary

This is a project that will integrate into Centos 7 based machines and control them from the CLI. This project is designed so that an individual can have a tool to manage their VPS without the need for license costs with commercial control panels, and without the worry of free control panels that can easily be exploited.

This project contains the prefix "SAASCP" as it will grow if used by work related customers into supporting an API that will be managed by a remote Java/Spring 4 based system to control any number of VPS's from a single interface.

It was also planned to ensure things were fully compatible with AWS, so a new machine could be spun up, this project downloaded and run, and integrated into a different server for remote management.

This project supports:
Add/Delete DNS Records
Add/Delete Email Account (PostFix Integration)
Add/Delete of Apache Httpd Vhosts
Add/Delete of MySQL User/DB + Priv Assignment
